## Jane's Walk Tour Proposal
A project outlining diversity and inclusivity.

**Background**

It was 4 centuries ago that the French settled in what is now called Ontario. Their presence has not always been welcomed, as demonstrated by the fights they had to keep their language and culture. First, the Regulation 17 from 1912 to 1917 prohibited French from being taught in schools. The Montfort event from 1997 to 2002 reflects their resilience, as the fought the closure of a French language hospital in Ontario. More recently the 2018 protest against the provincial government’s budget cuts which affected francophones, namely by eliminated funding for the francophone university in the Greater Toronto Area. Throughout these battles, the cultural and ethnic makeup of Franco-Ontarians has changed to become more inclusive of other French speaking countries. As of the 2021 Canadian census, 3.4% (484 425) of Ontario denote French as first language spoken at home with 11.1% (1 550 545) having a knowledge of French. In Toronto, 1.4% (38 695) denote French as first language spoken at home with 8.6% (238 505) having knowledge of French.

When building inclusive cities, we must consider the historical cultural heritage of communities. By listening to these communities, policies can be written in a way that considers the variety of knowledge. The communities must fit into the existing city make up.

Having grown up in the francophone community, it is important to realize the current diversity of francophones in Ontario, and certainly Toronto as a multicultural city. As such, this tour will guide us through important landmarks and institutions that reflect the history of Franco-Ontarians.

Therefore, three important questions are at hand.

Were New France’s activities with indigenous people seen as early colonisation or simply as commerce?

Is the Franco-Ontario population properly included as part of a historical context in the City of Toronto?

**Étienne Brulé Park**

This park is named after the French explorer Étienne Brulé who in 1610 arrived in what is now called Ontario. Brulé lived amongst the indigenous people, adopting their language and way of life, a key feature of how the relationship between Europeans and indigenous people occurred in New France. In fact, during Samuel de Champlain’s campaign against the Iroquois with the Hurons, Brulé joined the Hurons making their way south, presumably using the Humber River to reach Lake Ontario. Nearby streets south of Bloor St are also named after him, including Brule Crescent, Brule Gardens and Brule Terrace. The city’s decision to use this name holds a significant contribution to the history of French presence in Ontario, as Brulé was possibly one of the first to see these lands occupied by indigenous people.

**Fort Rouillé**

Trading post between the French and indigenous people existed along the shores of Lake Ontario, the first in 1720 along the Humber River, the second 1750 at the mouth of the Humber River and finally Fort Rouillé in 1750-51 until its ordered destruction in 1759. Stone is laid on the former boundaries of the fort, with a plaque indicating its function as a fur trading post. This marks an important relationship between indigenous people, as trade was of high importance in New France. With current knowledge of how indigenous people were treated in Canada, the monument provides a reflective moment to consider New France’s initial trading with indigenous people.

**Alliance Française Toronto**

This non-profit organization aims to “embody the current value of humanism, respect for linguistics, and cultural diversity”. Their service towards the community includes a French language school offering diverse cultural activities and courses to promote the language and bilingualism. Indeed, they cater to not only school children, but adults with different levels of French language abilities. Their commitment shows how the diversity of learning is important to maintain a strong community within a large metropolis. Franco-Ontarian make up not only decedents of New France, but also people from other French speaking countries.

**Université de l'Ontario Français**

The recently opened campus is a key success of the fights to protect francophone cultural heritage. After the 2018 protest, the government reinstated their commitment to fund the university with the Université de l’Ontario français Act, 2017. As preamble, the Act states that “The French language is an historic and honoured language in Ontario. The establishment of a university with a mission to serve the French-speaking community will help to promote a strong, vibrant, inclusive Francophone culture[…].”, a clear indication of the importance of this community to offer higher education. The university offers a short program on immigration, diversity, and inclusion, “focusing on the diversity of peoples and individuals in society, the cohabitation of diverse languages and cultures, population and migration […] to respond to needs of the labour market”. Other programs aim to respond to the current needs of market seeking bilingual individuals.
