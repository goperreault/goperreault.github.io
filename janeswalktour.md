## Jane's Walk Tour Proposal
A project outlining diversity and inclusivity.

**Background**
It was 4 centuries ago that French Canadians settled in what is now called Ontario. Their presence has not always been welcomed, as demonstrated by the fights they had to keep their language and culture. First, the Regulation 17 from 1912 to 1917 prohibited French from being taught in schools. The Montfort event from 1997 to 2002 reflects their resilience. The recent 2018 protest to the provincial government’s budget cuts affected francophones, namely by eliminated funding for the francophone university in the Greater Toronto Area. Throughout these battles, the cultural and ethnic makeup of franco-Ontarians has changed to become more inclusive of other French speaking countries. As of the 2021 census, (demographics).
When building inclusive cities, we must consider the historical cultural heritage of communities. By listening to these communities, policies can be written in a way that considers the variety of knowledge. The communities must fit into the existing city make up.
Having grown up in the francophone community, it is important to realize the current diversity of francophones in Ontario, and certainly Toronto as a multicultural city. As such, this tour will guide us through important landmarks and institutions that reflect the history of franco-Ontarians.

**Étienne Brulé Park**
This park is named after the French explorer Étienne Brulé who in 1610 arrived in what is now called Ontario. The city’s decision to use this name holds a significant contribution to the history of French presence in Ontario.

**Fort Rouillé**
A trading post between the French and indigenous people existed between 1720 until 1759. The Toronto Historical Board erected a monument in 1980 to commemorate the fort’s history. This marks an important relationship between indigenous people, as trade was of high importance for the people.

**Alliance Française Toronto**
This non-profit organization aims to “embody the current value of humanism, respect for linguistics, and cultural diversity”. Their service towards the community includes a French language school offering diverse cultural activities and courses to promote the language and bilingualism.

**Université de l'Ontario Français**
The recently opened campus is a key success of the fights to protect francophone cultural heritage.
