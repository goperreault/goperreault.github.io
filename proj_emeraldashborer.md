# Emerald Ash Borer in Mississauga
During the summer of 2017 I had worked on a project that involved the emerald ash borer infestation in Mississauga. The project looked at the removal and treatment of ash trees to locate the highest concentration of removed trees in the city. I had found two areas in the city where removal was in the hundred of trees.
