# About me
My name is Guillaume Perreault. I received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Toronto in 2019 where I majored in Geographic Information Systems and minored in geography (human geography focused) and french studies. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Planning & Urban Development at Toronto Metropolitan University .
My studies complemented my interests in urban transportation.
